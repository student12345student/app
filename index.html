  <h1 id="Three-Musketeers">The 3 Musketeers</h1>
  <h2>By Erik Kiszniewski</h2>
  <div>
  <p><br>According to Legends, there was the stuff of Legends. Foes and people with legendary awesomeness if this was Kung Fu Panda. There was once destruction and chaos in civilization. There was no piece, no order, no discipline or fun. Then 3 men arrived to restore what almost never existed. Their names were LeTeer, Musky <span class="Bryant">Bryant</span>, and their sole leader, in the form of a child, <span class="Airik">Airik</span>. Together they were the most unstoppable force in human history as a trio. Word spread of them and they eventually got the nickname, you may even know it, can you guess it, well I’m gonna tell you anyway. THEY WERE THE 3 MUSKETEERS.
<p><br>
  No matter who they faced, no one could beat them until one day they met a foe with equal footing. They were known as the <em>Bad Boy Pistons</em>. Many years ago the original Bad Boy Pistons terrorized civilization but then civilization terrorized them, led by some Jordan guy but he doesn’t matter in this story. The Bad Boys were led by Isiah Tom, Billy Lamby, and Mahorny. “Inspired” in some way from the original Bad Boys they sought out to finish what they couldn’t. And so they met face to face with each other in a grueling battle which would go on for quite some time until at least it was done. The Bad Boy Pistons weren’t so Bad Boys anymore and peace had been restored once again by THE 3 MUSKETEERS. And to remind you again their names are Leteer, Musky Bryant, and Airik. Forming together <strong>THE 3 MUSKETEERS</strong>.Sadly it’s only a story. Or at least some say.
